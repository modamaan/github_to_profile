## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Avoid `any` types - use proper types or `unknown`
- Define interfaces for data structures
- Use type inference where appropriate

### Code Style

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Add comments for complex logic, but avoid obvious comments
- Maximum line length: 100 characters (soft limit)

### File Organization

- Keep related functionality together
- Use the existing directory structure
- Place new utilities in appropriate `lib/utils/` files
- Create new modules in `lib/modules/` if needed

### API Routes

- Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
- Return appropriate status codes
- Handle errors gracefully with clear error messages
- Validate input data
- Use TypeScript types for request/response

### Database

- Use Prisma migrations for schema changes
- Add indexes for frequently queried fields
- Keep migrations focused and atomic
- Test migrations on a copy of production data

### Components

- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use Shadcn/ui components when possible
- Follow the existing component structure

## Testing

Before submitting a PR:

1. **Lint your code:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

2. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Test manually:**
   - Test the feature you added
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios
   - Verify no console errors

## Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when applicable

Examples:
```
Add custom URL validation
Fix GitHub API rate limit handling
Update README with deployment instructions
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if you've changed functionality
2. **Add comments** to complex code sections
3. **Ensure all tests pass** and the build succeeds
4. **Request review** from maintainers
5. **Address feedback** promptly and professionally
